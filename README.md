If you just want to try the applications, clone (download) the repo and get the files inside <FCS Lit Manager/bin/Debug> folder and run the <FCS Lit Manager.exe> file.

When you browse for a folder, the database files name starting from <LitManDB> will be created. Please do not delete them, or else you will lose all your configurations.

[More details will come soon]
